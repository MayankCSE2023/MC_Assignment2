# MyWeatherApp Implementation Overview

## WeatherApp

The `WeatherApp` composable function is responsible for displaying the weather data UI. It takes a `WeatherViewModel` instance and a `Context` as parameters.

### Parameters:
- `weatherViewModel`: An instance of the `WeatherViewModel` class, which handles API requests to fetch weather data.
- `context`: The context of the MainActivity, used for checking internet connectivity.

### Components:
- **OutlinedTextField**: This is an input field where the user can enter the date (in YYYY-MM-DD format) for which they want to retrieve weather data.
- **Text**: This component is used to display error messages in case of invalid input or network issues.
- **Column**: A layout component used to arrange child components vertically.
- **Spacer**: Adds spacing between components.
- **CoroutineScope**: Used to launch coroutines for handling asynchronous tasks.

### Functions:
- **isValidDate**: Validates the input date format (YYYY-MM-DD).
- **isInternetConnected**: Checks if the device is connected to the internet.
- **WeatherViewModel.getWeatherData**: Fetches weather data from the API based on the provided latitude, longitude, and date.

## WeatherViewModel

The `WeatherViewModel` class is responsible for handling API requests to fetch weather data. It uses Retrofit to make network calls.

### Functions:
- **getWeatherData**: Fetches weather data from the API based on the provided latitude, longitude, and date.

## WeatherService

The `WeatherService` interface defines the API endpoints for fetching weather data. It uses Retrofit annotations to specify the HTTP method, endpoint, and parameters.

## Data Classes

### WeatherData
- Represents the weather data retrieved from the API.
- Contains a single property `daily`, which holds the daily weather information.

### DailyWeather
- Represents the daily weather information.
- Contains lists of timestamps (`time`) and corresponding maximum and minimum temperatures (`temperature_2m_max` and `temperature_2m_min`).

## MainActivity

The `MainActivity` class sets up the UI using Jetpack Compose. It initializes the `WeatherViewModel` and sets the content view to the `WeatherApp` composable function.

### Components:
- **AppCompatActivity**: The base class for activities that use the support library action bar features.

## Screens Package

Contains UI-related composable functions (`WeatherApp`) for displaying weather data.

## Services Package

Contains the `WeatherService` interface, which defines API endpoints for fetching weather data.

## Data Package

Contains data classes (`WeatherData` and `DailyWeather`) representing the structure of weather data retrieved from the API.
